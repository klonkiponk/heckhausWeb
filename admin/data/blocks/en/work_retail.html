For our client we developed a shop-in-shop system, which had its world premiere at the ISPO fair in Munich. For the implementation we chose high-grade natural materials like oakwood and linoleum, to emphasize the brand´s ambition and vision. For further stages of our design, we are envision an adaption of this shop-in-shop system on various store sizes. You will hear more about it soon...

In the popular “Marmot Store”, located close to the main street of this sports town, ZOOT is now as well integrated within the sales areas. With a high recognition value, the brand  presents itself to sport-oriented customers. For 2014 further retail spaces are planned for ZOOT – you may be curious...

With the successful implementation of the first proper shop-in-shop system in the well-known ‘evaSion running’ concept store in Barcelona, Zoot has managed to position itself self-confidently and prominently. With more than 80 different sports brands, this store in Barcelona is one of the largest sporting goods stores in Europe. Here Zoot presented with a floor-space design and in addition also thereby increased its notoriety in the triathlon-sport.
<br><br>
The Zoot trademark was founded in 1983 in Kona, Hawaii, and since that time has been a pioneer in innovative competitive and training solutions for triathletes: in addition it belongs to the umbrella brand of K2 Sports. The high-quality products feature technological advantages, immense diversity, and outstanding design. The range of products includes running shoes, wetsuits, as well as all the typical accessories. We have developed a characteristic emotional brandname experience that stands out in terms of the diversity and high quality of the products translated three-dimensionally in space. In order to allow customers to experience these qualities in a shop, inspirations from the pregnant world of shapes, were creatively translated colours and images were creatively translated into the space in three dimensions. Strong colours, contrasts, and materials accentuate  the innovative functions of the products and make the power of the brand visible. Glossy surfaces and 3D elements strengthen the emotionalization and support the authentic character. With movable modules, the customer himself/herself creates a dynamical, continually changing appearance for the shop and and in this way opens up various different levels of information about the product. The shop system is framed by yellow brackets that, as an element of the corporate identity, were utilized by Zoot and demarcate the shop on the floor space.

For the first time, Heinz Kettler GmbH & Co.

Resourceful solutions were used to create a modular system, which ensures the flexible, clearly structured design of the company's home fitness section. The new branded area concept was presented to trade visitors at the Kettler stand during the ispo winter 09 trade show in Munich.
