<h2 class="red">WORK FLOW</h2>
 <section class="details">
<div class="toggled" data-id="weProfileWorkFlow">
The first step in developing an individual design language is active communication with our clients about their ideas, goals and expectations for their brand. That's why we listen very carefully, ask very specific questions and zoom in on the task for each specific project. Together, we analyse the different approaches that are possible. This way, a frame within which concrete ideas can mature is defined.<br>
	 <br>
	      Design: While factoring in your company's wishes and ideas, we come up with a concept, based on sketches and drafts. To give you an initial impression, we provide you with a 3-D visualization containing the key details of the finished work. And, of course, the development phase of the project also includes careful discussion of the drafts and any adaptations or modifications that prove necessary.<br>
	 <br>
	      Planning: Once an order has been placed, we proceed with the planning work: materials, colors, sizes, lighting, etc., are all itemized. Technical drawings are produced for the production department. If necessary, more precise measurements are made and a timetable for the project is drawn up.<br>
	 <br>
	      Realisation: Working with skilled partners and creative minds from many different sectors, we convert our plans into an outstanding finished product. We pride ourselves on creating spaces in which people can feel at home while maintaining an all-important balance between form and function. The thoughtful use of lighting, materials and colors creates the perfect atmosphere. Accordingly, we attach prime importance to details and to overall impressions. Throughout the process - from initial discussions with the customer to the completed project - we play a hands-on role, taking responsibility for all the development and creative work.<br>
